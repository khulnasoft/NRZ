Enable faster tooling for your Nrz locally with one, interactive command.

You'll be taken through a short series of steps to enable the fastest settings for your Nrz. These optimizations include:

- **Git FS Monitor**: `nrz` leans on Git to do file change discovery. Since we have to wait for `git` to tell us about changes, we can use [Git's built-in filesystem monitor](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-fsmonitor--daemon) to get those notifications sooner.
- **Nrz Daemon**: Nrz's daemon optimistically understands your repository in the background. By doing shared, common work that `nrz` will need to do when running tasks beforehand, `nrz` will run your tasks faster.
- **Remote Caching**: While Nrz can cache your work locally, it can also share a cache across all of your machines. Enabling [Remote Caching](/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) makes your caching **multiplayer**, ensuring that you, your teammates, and your CI machines, never do the same work twice.
- **Check `nrz` version**: We're always working towards making `nrz` better. To ensure you are using the latest version of Nrz, we'll check your version and remind you to install `latest` if you aren't using it yet.
- **Check for Nrz LSP**:
  Visit the [VSCode Extension Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Khulnasoft.nrz-vsc) and install the Nrz LSP extension for your IDE.
