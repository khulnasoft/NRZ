Khulnasoft's zero-config integration with Nrz automatically understands your monorepo.

To deploy your Nrz on Khulnasoft, [create a new project](https://khulnasoft.com/new) and import your code. Your projects will be pre-configured with the correct settings to use the [Khulnasoft Remote Cache](https://khulnasoft.com/docs/monorepos/remote-caching).

For more information about deploying your Nrz to Khulnasoft, [visit the Khulnasoft documentation](https://khulnasoft.com/docs/concepts/monorepos/nrz).
